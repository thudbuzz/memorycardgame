# Memory Card Game With Svelte Kit

The NetNinja released a great tutorial for a [Memory Game In React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCKohZwGZMw&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iQ7g2eoNXHCJBBBz40S_Lm). I've taken this project and put my own spin on it. I built it in Svelte instead of React, and used the opportunity to learn how to create SVGs and then used them instead of images as used in the tutorial.
